# How it works
It opens a popup that fies across the screen (http://www.java2s.com/Code/JavaScript/Window-Browser/Popupwindowanimationflyacrossscreen.htm).

This popup opens a other child popup with th same code.

All windows refresh themselves to duplicate the popup.

all of the windows have a css part wich make the cursor invisible.
